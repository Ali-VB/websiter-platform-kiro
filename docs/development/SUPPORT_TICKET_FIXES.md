# Support Ticket System Fixes

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. Client Dashboard Not Showing Admin Responses ✅

**Problem**: Clients couldn't see responses from admin in their dashboard

**Solution**:

- Updated `SupportTickets.tsx` to display conversation thread with admin responses
- Added proper styling to differentiate between client and admin messages
- Responses are now sorted chronologically and displayed in a conversation format
- Admin responses show with "🛠️ Support Team" label and special styling

### 2. File Upload Not Working ✅

**Problem**: File upload in ticket creation modal was non-functional with no size limitations

**Solution**:

- Created `StorageService` for handling file uploads to Supabase Storage
- Added drag-and-drop functionality with visual feedback
- Implemented file validation (10MB max, 5 files max, specific file types)
- Added file preview with size display and remove functionality
- Created `ticket_attachments` database table for storing file metadata
- Updated ticket creation to handle file uploads
- Added attachments display in both client and admin ticket views

## 🗄️ Database Changes Required

### New Table: `ticket_attachments`

Run this SQL script in Supabase Dashboard:

```sql
-- Create ticket_attachments table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.ticket_attachments (
    id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
    ticket_id UUID REFERENCES public.support_tickets(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
    file_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    file_path TEXT NOT NULL,
    file_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    file_size INTEGER NOT NULL,
    file_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    uploaded_by UUID REFERENCES public.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_ticket_attachments_ticket_id ON public.ticket_attachments(ticket_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_ticket_attachments_uploaded_by ON public.ticket_attachments(uploaded_by);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE public.ticket_attachments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- RLS Policies
CREATE POLICY "Clients can read own ticket attachments" ON public.ticket_attachments FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM public.support_tickets
        WHERE id = ticket_id AND client_id = auth.uid()
    )
);

CREATE POLICY "Clients can upload to own tickets" ON public.ticket_attachments FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    auth.uid() = uploaded_by AND
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM public.support_tickets
        WHERE id = ticket_id AND client_id = auth.uid()
    )
);

CREATE POLICY "Admins can read all attachments" ON public.ticket_attachments FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM public.users
        WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
    )
);

CREATE POLICY "Admins can upload to any ticket" ON public.ticket_attachments FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM public.users
        WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
    )
);

CREATE POLICY "Admins can delete any attachment" ON public.ticket_attachments FOR DELETE USING (
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM public.users
        WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
    )
);
```

### Storage Bucket Setup

Create a storage bucket in Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to Storage → Buckets
2. Create new bucket named `ticket-attachments`
3. Set it as public (for file access)

## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Database Setup:

1. Run the SQL script in Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor

3. Verify tables and policies are created correctly

### 2. File Upload Testing:

1. Create a new support ticket
2. Try uploading different file types (images, PDFs, documents)
3. Test file size limits (try uploading >10MB file)
4. Test file count limits (try uploading >5 files)
5. Test drag & drop functionality

### 3. Response Testing:

1. Create a ticket as a client
2. Log in as admin and respond to the ticket
3. Log back in as client and verify response is visible
4. Check that conversation thread displays properly

### 4. Attachment Viewing:

1. Create ticket with attachments
2. Verify attachments show in client dashboard
3. Verify attachments show in admin dashboard
4. Test downloading/opening attachments
