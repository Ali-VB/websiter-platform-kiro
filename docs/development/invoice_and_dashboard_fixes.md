  // Company header with branding
  pdf.setFontSize(20);
  pdf.setTextColor(59, 130, 246);
  pdf.text("WEBSITER", 20, 30);

  // Invoice details, client info, itemized billing
  // Tax calculations, totals, notes
  // Professional formatting and layout

  return pdf;
};

// Download and preview functions
export const downloadInvoicePDF = (project, invoiceData) => {
  const pdf = generateInvoicePDF(project, invoiceData);
  pdf.save(`invoice-${invoiceData.invoiceNumber}-${project.clientName}.pdf`);
};

export const previewInvoicePDF = (project, invoiceData) => {
  const pdf = generateInvoicePDF(project, invoiceData);
  const pdfUrl = URL.createObjectURL(pdf.output("blob"));
  window.open(pdfUrl, "_blank");
};
```

### **Enhanced User Dashboard**:

```typescript
// Added invoice functionality to user dashboard
const handleViewInvoice = (project: ProjectRow) => {
  setSelectedProject(project);
  setIsInvoiceModalOpen(true);
};

<ClientInvoiceModal project={selectedProject} isOpen={isInvoiceModalOpen} onClose={handleCloseInvoiceModal} />;
