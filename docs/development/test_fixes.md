# Testing the Duplicate and Generic Name Fixes

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Website Type Mapping Issue** ✅

- **Problem**: PurposeStep was sending IDs like "business", "blog", "store" but the mapping function expected full names
- **Fix**: Updated `mapWebsiteType()` to handle both ID format and full names
- **Result**: Projects now get correct website types instead of defaulting to "company_portfolio"

### 2. **Generic Project Names** ✅

- **Problem**: All projects had generic names like "Company_portfolio Website for Client"
- **Fix**:
  - Fixed website type mapping to get correct types
  - Updated project title generation with better labels
  - Extract actual client names from client_details JSON
- **Result**: Projects now have descriptive names like:
  - "Business Website for John Smith"
  - "Online Store for ABC Electronics"
  - "Blog Website for Sarah Johnson"

### 3. **Duplicate Projects from React StrictMode** ✅

- **Problem**: React.StrictMode causes double execution in development
- **Fix**:
  - Temporarily disabled StrictMode
  - Enhanced duplicate prevention with better submission tracking
  - Added robust database checks before project creation
- **Result**: Only one project created per website request

### 4. **Enhanced Duplicate Prevention** ✅

- **Problem**: Multiple layers of duplicate creation
- **Fix**:
  - App-level: Better submission ID tracking based on actual data
  - Service-level: Enhanced database checks with logging
  - Database-level: Prepared SQL for unique constraints
- **Result**: Multiple safeguards prevent duplicates

## Test Steps:

1. **Test Different Website Types**:

   - Create "Business" website → Should create "Business Website for [Name]"
   - Create "Online Store" → Should create "Online Store for [Name]"
   - Create "Blog" → Should create "Blog Website for [Name]"
   - Create "Portfolio" → Should create "Portfolio Website for [Name]"

2. **Test Duplicate Prevention**:

   - Try submitting the same form multiple times rapidly
   - Should only create one project per unique submission

3. **Test Name Generation**:

   - Use different client names and company names
   - Project titles should reflect the actual names entered

4. **Check Admin Dashboard**:
   - "All Projects" tab should now show projects properly
   - Each project should have unique, descriptive names
   - No duplicate projects should appear

## Debugging Tools:

- Use the "Clean Duplicate Projects" button in Debug Panel if needed
- Check browser console for detailed logging during submission
- All database operations now have enhanced logging

## Expected Results:

✅ **No more duplicate projects**
✅ **Descriptive project names based on website type and client name**  
✅ **All Projects tab shows projects correctly**
✅ **Enhanced logging for debugging**
