# Client Dashboard Test

## To test if confirmation is working:

### 1. Check Database Directly

Run this SQL in Supabase to see project statuses:

```sql
SELECT id, title, status, client_id, updated_at
FROM projects
WHERE client_id = 'YOUR_CLIENT_USER_ID'
ORDER BY updated_at DESC;
```

### 2. Check Browser Console

When you confirm a project as admin, check the browser console for:

- "✅ Project confirmed successfully"
- "✅ Website request also updated to confirmed"

### 3. Check Client Dashboard

As a client user, check:

- Does the progress bar show "Confirmed" step?
- Is there a green celebration banner?
- Does the status badge show "Confirmed"?

### 4. Force Refresh

Try refreshing the client dashboard page to see if the status updates.

## Debugging Steps:

1. **Admin confirms project** → Check console logs
2. **Check database** → Verify status is "confirmed"
3. **Client dashboard** → Should show updated status
4. **If not working** → Check real-time subscription

## Expected Flow:

1. Admin clicks "Confirm Project & Update Client"
2. Project status changes to "confirmed" in database
3. Client dashboard real-time subscription picks up change
4. Progress bar advances to "Confirmed" step
5. Green celebration banner appears
