**Overall Completion**: ~75% (Missing critical payment functionality)

## üö® Immediate Action Required

**The payment integration (Task 9) is the most critical missing piece that prevents the complete user workflow from functioning. Without payment processing, users cannot complete their orders and the entire business model fails.**

**Recommendation**: Focus immediately on implementing Stripe payment integration as the minimum viable payment solution, then add PayPal and Interac e-Transfer as additional options.
